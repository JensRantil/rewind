Have you ever been nervous of all those DBMSs schema changes when you
are deploying your applications? They are gonna take too long, or break
backward compatibility? Have you ever thought "Crap, I wish I had stored
that information since earlier"? Have you ever felt your writing
patterns and your reading patterns differ a lot, making things harder to
scale?

CQRS (Command-Query Response Segregation) is an architectural pattern
that aims to solve these issues by splitting up your architectural
system into two parts:

* A *write side* that takes care of validating input and optimizes for
  fast writes. The write side takes commands and outputs corresponding
  events if the command validates correctly.

* A *read side* that listens to incoming events from the write side. The
  read side is optimized for fast reads.

A core concept in CQRS is the *event store* which sits inbetween the
write and the read side. The event store takes care of three things:

* persisting all events to disk.
  
* being a hub/broker replicating all events from the write to the read
  side of things.
  
* it allows fast querying of events so that different parts of the system
  can be synced back on track and new components can be brought back in
  play.

*Rewind* is an event store application that talks ZeroMQ. It is written
in Python and supports multiple storage backends.

Installing
==========

PyPi
----
Rewind `exists on PyPi`_ and can be downloaded by issuing::

    $ pip install rewind

.. _exists on PyPi: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rewind/

Manual install
--------------
Rewind uses basic ``setuptools``. Installation can be used done as
follows::

    $ git clone https://github.com/JensRantil/rewind.git
    $ cd rewind
    $ python setup.py install

However **NOTE**, that this will install Rewind globally in your Python
environment and is NOT recommended. Please refer to virtualenv_ on how to
create a virtual environment.

.. _virtualenv: http://www.virtualenv.org

Talking to `rewind`
===================
Rewind has three different wire protocols. Each is using ZeroMQ as low
level transport protocol. Wire protocol has one single ZeroMQ endpoint
in Rewind:

* A receiving socket.

* A streaming socket.

* A socket for querying Rewind.

Each endpoint is configurable through command line when starting
``rewind``. Issue ``rewind --help`` to get a list of the specific
command line arguments ``rewind`` can handle.

*Note that the wire protocol is still under heavy development. Pull
requests and improvement proposals are welcome!*

Receiving events
----------------
The receiving end is the end that received incoming events. Rewind does
not make any assumptions about what an event looks like. In fact, it
only sees it as a binary blob of bytes.

Rewind uses a ZeroMQ PULL socket for receiving events. Every event is a
single non-multipart message where the content of the message is the
binary blob.

Streaming events
----------------
Every incoming event gets broadcast to all sockets connected to the
streaming socket. The streaming socket a ZeroMQ socket of type PUB.

Every message received automatically gets assigned a unique event id
(UUID, type 1) by Rewind. This event id is used for querying events (see
below). Each sent message from the streaming is a multipart message that
consists of two parts:

1. The event ID. The client should view this is a series of bytes.

2. The event content. This is the exact same bytes that were
   correspondingly sent to the receiving socket.

Querying events
---------------
The socket for querying Rewind is the one which has the most advanced
wire protocol. The socket is of type RES and takes commands. A typical
converation between a client (C) and Rewind (R) looks like this::

    C: Request
    R: Response
    C: Request
    R: Response
    ...

Request
```````
Each request is a multipart message. The first part is a string that
specifies the type of request. Currently there's only one type of
request, namely "QUERY".

For the "QUERY" request type the next two message parts must be:

* Contains an optional event id, or an empty part. Restricts the
  earliest (chronologically) incoming message that we are interested in
  to all messages received after the event with the specified event id.
  Note that this does not include the message with the specified event
  id. If this part of the message is empty, no lower restriction is made
  and messages will be returned starting from the first event ever seen.

* Contains an optional event id, or an empty part. Restricts the latest
  (chronologically) incoming message that we are interested in to all
  messages received before, or including, the event with the specified
  event id. If this part of the message is empty, no upper restriction
  is made and messages will be returned starting from the first event
  ever seen.

If you are a data structure type-of-guy you could view Rewind as a
distributed insert-ordered map (event id => event) that allows querying
of ranges of events based on event ids.

Response
````````
A response can be one of two things:

* A single message starting with the ASCII text ``ERROR``. This means an
  error occured. The rest of message contains a human readable
  description of the actual error that occured. This information can be
  highly useful for remote clients to debug any problems that might
  arise.

* A resultset containing events. It's a multipart message containing
  frames like so; eventid #1, event #1, eventid #2, event #2, eventid
  #3, event #3, ... where eventid #X is the event id for event X. At
  most 100 messages will be returned. If Rewind did not cap number of
  events, the result will be appended by a last frame containing the
  ASCII content "END". It is up to the client to make requests
  repeatedly if the result set is capped.

Developing
==========
Getting started developing `rewind` is quite straightforward. The
library uses `setuptools` and standard Python project layout for tests
etcetera.

Checking out
------------
To start developing you need to install the ZeroMQ library on your system
beforehand.

This is how you check out the `rewind` library into a virtual environment::

    cd <your development directory>
    virtualenv --no-site-packages rewind
    cd rewind
    git clone http://<rewind GIT URL> src

Workin' the code
----------------
Every time you want to work on `rewind` you want to change directory
into the source folder and activate the virtual environment scope (so
that you don't touch the global Python environment)::

    cd src
    source ../bin/activate

The first time you've checked the project out, you want to initialize
development mode::

    python setup.py develop

Runnin' them tests
------------------
Running the test suite is done by issuing::

    python setup.py nosetests

. Nose is configured to automagically spit out test coverage information
after the whole test suite has been executed.

As always, try to run the test suite *before* starting to mess with the
code. That way you know nothing was broken beforehand.

`The Rewind central github repository`_ also has `Travis CI`
integration that can be accessed at
http://travis-ci.org/#!/JensRantil/rewind Every time a pull request is
being made to https://github.com/JensRantil/rewind, Travis CI will make
a commend about whether the pull request breaks the test suite or not.

Helping out
===========
Spelling mistakes, bad grammar, new storage backends, wire format
improvements, test improvements and other feature additions are all
welcome. Please issue pull requests or create an issue if you'd like to
discuss it on Github.

Why the name "Rewind"?
======================
Pick and choose:

* Rewind can look at what happened in the past and replay the events
  since then.

* It's time to rewind and rethink the way we are overusing DBMS's and
  the way we are storing our data.
